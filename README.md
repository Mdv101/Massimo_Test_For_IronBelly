# Massimo_Test_For_IronBelly

I like to make the most of my efforts, so I took the test as an opportunity to practice TDD. I'm not entirely happy with my solution to the problem of finding the closest neighbor, but thanks to the test I got to know the K-Maps that I will be studying shortly, so thanks for that. As always, I am very attentive to any feedback 

#Test
-Write a pooling system :

    -Should be as generic as possible

    -Allows you to choose the amount of objects to put in the pool by default per object in the pool.

    -Should allow expansion of the pool.

 

-Write a script "FindNearestNeighbour" that will automatically find the nearest GameObject that also have this script attached to it :

    -This script should prioritize execution time (be as optimized as possible)

    -If a new GameObject is instantiated with this script attached it should be taken in account by the other gameobjects.

    -Display the closest gameobject by drawing a line in between the two gameobjects.

 

-Write a system making gameobjects with a specific script attached to them move randomly (3D space) within a zone that can be defined by three floats x,y,z exposed to the editor.

    -This system should prioritize execution time (be as optimized as possible).

 

-Create an example scene implementing the previous three tasks :

    -Create a prefab with a cube GameObject (Just a mesh renderer, no need for any kind of physics or collider), add the FindNearestNeighbour script + the random movement script

    -Should use the pooling system to spawn/despawn the previously created prefab.

    -Create a simple UI displaying the current amount of spawned prefabs + an input field.

    -Create a script that spawn x amount of the prefab on start and lets you spawn and despawn x prefabs (x gets its value from the input field) with keys that are exposed to the editor. The spawned prefab should be spawned at a random position within the zone created by the last task system.
