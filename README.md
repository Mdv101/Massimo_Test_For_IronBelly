# Massimo_Test_For_IronBelly

I like to make the most of my efforts, so I took the test as an opportunity to practice TDD. I'm not entirely happy with my solution to the problem of finding the closest neighbor, but thanks to the test I got to know the K-Maps that I will be studying shortly, so thanks for that. As always, I am very attentive to any feedback
